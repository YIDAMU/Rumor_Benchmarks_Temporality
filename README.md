Itâ€™s about Time: Rethinking Evaluation on Rumor Detection Benchmarks using Chronological Splits (EACL 2023 Findings)



If you use these four benchmarks, please also cite:

(i) Detect rumors in microblog posts using propagation structure via kernel learning. (https://aclanthology.org/P17-1066/)

(ii) Detecting rumors from microblogs with recurrent neural networks. (https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/537.pdf)

(iii) Analysing how people orient to and spread rumours in social media by looking at conversational threads. (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150989)
